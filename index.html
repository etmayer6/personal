            <h2>Projects</h2>
                <h3>LearnSphere</h3>
                    <p>Currently working on an education support app. LearnSphere will use file sharing in order to make instructor grading easier, features to make communication more simple between instructors and students, and between students and students. The app is going to be entirely in Java, using Springboot and Android Studio to develop.</p>
                <h3>Fitness App</h3>
                    <p>Created a simple interactive fitness app using React and Expo Go in order to help with my workout routine.</p>
                <h3>SpamGram</h3>
                    <p>Class group project. Created a location-based social media app which allows college students to live chat with students in the same area and university. The app has anonymous profiles, and uses phone number verification to create the profiles. Used Mongo DB and Node JS for backend, React and Expo for frontend.</p>
                <h3>Accessibility Add-In</h3>
                    <p>Created a Microsoft Word Add-In for ISU Extension. Consists of some buttons which will make things easier for people.</p>
                <h3>PokeGame</h3>
                    <p>Working on a text based adventure game which mimics Pokemon.</p>
                <h3>Car Odometer</h3>
                    <p>Created a working car odometer using Verilog. Build from scratch, down to individual logic gates all the way up to a working car odometer with number change animations.</p>

                <h3>Project 1</h3>
                <p>The first project is related to develop a single Web page using
                    only two technologies: HTML and CSS. The project consists on
                    creating a single web page with a menu at the top know as
                    Navitation Bar. We have to include text describing ourself and
                    text describing the project. Additionally, we need to include
                    two images: one image is of ourself and second image is anything
                    related to the project itself.</p>
